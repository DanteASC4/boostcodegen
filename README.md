### Boost Code Generator
---

A simple tool to create codes using the first letter of every word in a string. Also note that inputs are not case sensitive, the code will be caps. 
For multiple codes at once, paste each name so that they're on they're own line.

This would correctly generate two codes:
```
One Name Here
Second Name here
```

This would not:
```
One Name Here Second Name Here
```
